# tiles

# This file holds the configuration for all of the tiles in the game.
# It is a "TOML" file and the data must be formatted accordingly.

# Each tile starts a table entry
# e.g.
# [ID]
# sprite = " :red:black"
# ...

# the fields that you can set on a tile include:
# sprite = "<char>:<fg>:<bg>" or "<char>:<fg>" or "<bg>"

# colors can be either...
# - hex colors (#rgb, #rgba, #rrggbb, #rrggbbaa): e.g. #39f or #F407A935 
# . - hex is not case sensitive
# - named colors: colors that are pre-loaded (either in the colors file or from defaults): e.g. white
# . - names are case sensitive
